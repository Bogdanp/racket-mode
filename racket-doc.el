Uses the default external web browser.

If point is an identifier required in the current namespace that
has help, opens the web browser directly at that help
topic. (i.e. Uses the identifier variant of racket/help.)

Otherwise, opens the 'search for a term' page, where you can
choose among multiple possibilities. (i.e. Uses the string
variant of racket/help.)

With a C-u prefix, prompts for the identifier or quoted string,
instead of looking at point."
